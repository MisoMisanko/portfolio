        <p>
          The Easter-themed campaign marked a transformation for Wakelake from a party venue into a family-friendly destination. 
          This event kickstarted the season with a unique, engaging concept that combined tradition with sport, attracting families 
          and creating a welcoming atmosphere for a broader audience.

        <p>
          As part of this initiative, I also spearheaded the implementation of a new ticketing system and collaborated with graphic 
          designers to create signature wristbands. These efforts improved branding, streamlined operations, and enhanced the overall 
          customer experience.

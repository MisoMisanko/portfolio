        <h2>Role: Creative Lead & Copywriter</h2>
        <p>
          This award-winning project for the **Young Lions competition** involved crafting an ad campaign 
          that highlighted Bratislava's unique charm through a bold and locally-driven concept. 
          We earned **Bronze** for our creative approach to inviting tourists to explore the city through 
          the eyes of its residents.

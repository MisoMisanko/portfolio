        <h1>Craftholsters Social Media Campaign</h1>
        <h2>Role: Copywriter</h2>
        <p>
          As a copywriter for Craftholsters, I developed and executed a social media campaign that reflected the brand’s tone and connected 
          with its audience. The campaign’s centerpiece was a video highlighting the company’s unique products and values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key contributions:
          <ul>
            <li>Crafted engaging social media posts tailored to the brand's voice and audience.</li>
            <li>Collaborated with the video production team to ensure consistency in tone and messaging.</li>
            <li>Boosted audience engagement and brand awareness through creative storytelling.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This campaign demonstrated my ability to balance creativity with strategy, creating content that resonates with audiences and 
          delivers measurable results.
